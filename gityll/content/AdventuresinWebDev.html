        <h1>Adventures in Web Dev</h1>
        <div class="body">
            <p>So I&#39;ve spent the last 10 weeks working for Autodesk as a C++ developer. As someone who is questionably obsessed with Java, there was somewhat of a difficult transition period (birth of fire).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have a full write up talking about my experiences at Autodesk soon, but for now, I&#39;d like to talk about how I&#39;ve spent my new found freedom.</p>
<p>NodeJS is awesome! That&#39;s something I&#39;ve discovered in the last week working on <a href="https://github.com/aranscope/gityll">Gityll</a>. In ~300 lines, at the time of writing, I have a site generator, using Github as a CMS and Express as a backend. Gityll was originally a toy project, much like <a href="https://github.com/Manoj-nathwani/trello-music">this Trello sequencer</a> built by Manoj Nathwani, but I&#39;ve found it to be surprisingly useful and have since migrated my website over. </p>
<p>Github is a website I visit more than most, every time A cool project idea comes to mind I&#39;ll hop over, make a new repo and get some ideas down. Being able to manage my blog entirely from Github is much easier for me, not to mention that it brings ease to making project pages such as the one included in Gityll itself.</p>
